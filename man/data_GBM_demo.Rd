\usage{
data_GBM_demo
}
\description{
A GBM normalized gene expression matrix with selected genes.
}
\details{
The demo dataset gives the expression levels of genes which are involved in GO:0006306 (DNA methylation) and GO:0051781 (positive regulation of cell division) and have at least one neighbor on \link{network_demo}.
Each row corresponds to a gene. Each column corresponds to a sample. The first column are the numeric vertex indices.\cr\cr
The dataset is the extracted GBM part of an aggregated dataset of LGG, GBM, LUSC and LUAD datasets on TCGA after quantile normalization.\cr
LGG and GBM are two groups of brain tumors and are usually studied comparatively (as in this demo study).
