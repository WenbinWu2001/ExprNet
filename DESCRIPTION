Title: Characterizing Differential Expression of Selected Edges on a Network
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Wenbin Wu, Leqi Tian
Maintainer: Wenbin Wu <drkwu999@gmail.com>
Description: A toy model studying expressions of selected edges (namely a sub-network) on a network. We aim to characterize how the lengths of selected edges vary between two phenotypes based on t tests results. Two statistics, AT1 and AT2, are computed to summarize the t tests results and distinguish the differentially expressed patterns of the sub-network.
