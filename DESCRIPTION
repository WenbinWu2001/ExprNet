Description: A toy model studying expressions of selected edges (namely a sub-network) on a network. We aim to characterize how the lengths of selected edges vary between two phenotypes based on t tests results. Two statistics, AT1 and AT2, are computed to summarize the t tests results and distinguish the differentially expressed patterns of the sub-network.
